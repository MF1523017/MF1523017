> You are Beautiful<br>
My life is brilliant<br>
My life is brilliant<br>
My love is pure<br>
I saw an angel<br>
Of that I'm sure<br>
She smiled at me on the subway<br>
She was with another man<br>
But I won't lose no sleep on that<br>
Because I've got a plan<br>
You're beautiful. You're beautiful<br>
You're beautiful,it's true<br>
I saw your face in a crowded place<br>
And I don't know what to do<br>
Because I'll never be with you<br>
Yes, she caught my eye<br>
As we walked on by<br>
She could see from my face that I was flying high<br>
And I don't think that I'll see her again<br>
But we shared a moment that will last till the end<br>
You're beautiful. You're beautiful<br>
You're beautiful,it's true<br>
I saw your face in a crowded place<br>
And I don't know what to do<br>
Because I'll never be with you<br>
You're beautiful. You're beautiful<br>
You're beautiful,it's true<br>
There must be an angel with a smile on her face<br>
When she thought up that I should be with you<br>
But it's time to face the truth<br>
I will never be with you

  > If one day you feel like crying<br>
  Call me<br>
  I don't promise that I will make you laugh.<br>
  But I can cry with you<br>
  If one day you want to run away<br>
  Don't be afraid to call me<br>
  I don't promise to ask you to stop<br>
  But I can run with you<br>
  If one day you don't want to listen to anyone<br>
  Call me<br>
  I promise to be there for you<br>
  And I promise to be very quiet<br>
  But if one day you call <br>
  And there is no answer<br>
  Come fast to see me
  Perhaps I need you

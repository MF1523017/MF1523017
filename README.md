> You are Beautiful<br>
My life is brilliant<br>
My life is brilliant<br>
My love is pure<br>
I saw an angel<br>
Of that I'm sure<br>
She smiled at me on the subway<br>
She was with another man<br>
But I won't lose no sleep on that<br>
Because I've got a plan<br>
You're beautiful. You're beautiful<br>
You're beautiful,it's true<br>
I saw your face in a crowded place<br>
And I don't know what to do<br>
Because I'll never be with you<br>
Yes, she caught my eye<br>
As we walked on by<br>
She could see from my face that I was flying high<br>
And I don't think that I'll see her again<br>
But we shared a moment that will last till the end<br>
You're beautiful. You're beautiful<br>
You're beautiful,it's true<br>
I saw your face in a crowded place<br>
And I don't know what to do<br>
Because I'll never be with you<br>
You're beautiful. You're beautiful<br>
You're beautiful,it's true<br>
There must be an angel with a smile on her face<br>
When she thought up that I should be with you<br>
But it's time to face the truth<br>
I will never be with you
